Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
This program defines a function that calculates the factorial of a given number.
The function takes a number as input, computes its factorial using a loop or recursion, and returns the result.

Example:
If the function is called with 5
Output: Factorial of 5 is 120

Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
This program takes a number from the user and performs mathematical calculations using Python’s built-in math module.
It calculates the square root, natural logarithm (log base e), and sine (in radians) of the entered number.

Example:
Enter a number: 25
Square Root: 5.0
Natural Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine: -0.13235175009777303
